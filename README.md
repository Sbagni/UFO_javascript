**JavaScript and DOM Manipulation**


I used javascript to write this code that created a table dynamically based upon a [dataset](StarterCode/static/js/data.js). The code also allows users to filter the table data for specific values. I used JavaScript, HTML, and CSS, and D3.js on web pages. 


 **Automatic Table and Date Search**

Created HTML web page with the UFO dataset provided in the form of an array of JavaScript objects (JSON), wrote code that appends a table to web page and then adds new rows of data for each UFO sighting.

* There is  column for `date/time`, `city`, `state`, `country`, `shape`, and `comment`.

* Used a date form in HTML document and wrote JavaScript code that  listened for events and search through the `date/time` column to find rows that match user input.
